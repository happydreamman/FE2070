# General

This is the 1.4.0 release for Coqui STT, the deep learning toolkit for speech-to-text. In accordance with [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), this version is backwards compatible with previous 1.x versions. The compatibility guarantees of our semantic versioning cover the deployment APIs: the C API and all the official language bindings: Python, Node.JS/ElectronJS and Java/Android. You can get started with Coqui STT 1.4.0 by following the steps in our [documentation](https://stt.readthedocs.io/).

Compatible pre-trained models are available in the [Coqui Model Zoo](https://coqui.ai/models).

We also include example audio files:

[audio-1.4.0.tar.gz](https://github.com/coqui-ai/STT/releases/download/v1.4.0/audio-1.4.0.tar.gz)

which can be used to test the engine, and checkpoint files for the English model (which are identical to the 1.0.0 checkpoint and provided here for convenience purposes):

[coqui-stt-1.4.0-checkpoint.tar.gz](https://github.com/coqui-ai/STT/releases/download/v1.4.0/coqui-stt-1.4.0-checkpoint.tar.gz)

which are under the Apache 2.0 license and can be used as the basis for further fine-tuning. Finally this release also includes a source code tarball:

[v1.4.0.tar.gz](https://github.com/coqui-ai/STT/archive/v1.4.0.tar.gz)

Under the [MPL-2.0 license](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/). Note that this tarball is for archival purposes only since GitHub does not include submodules in the automatic tarballs. For usage and development with the source code, clone the repository using Git, following our [documentation](https://stt.readthedocs.io/).
